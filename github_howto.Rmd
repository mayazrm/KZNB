# Useful Links for setup:
[Using Github with RStudio](http://www.molecularecologist.com/2013/11/using-github-with-r-and-rstudio/)

# Setting Up a New Repository
1. Log in to Github
2. Click "New Repository"
3. Enter Repository Name, Select Public/Private (note that Private Repositories are only available with a paid subscription), and select "Initialize with a README" if you like
4. Copy the respository URL to your clipboard 
5. Save it to Github Desktop (if using)


# Working with Repository Contents in RStudio
1. Open RStudio
2. File > New Project > Version Control > Git
3. Paste the respository URL into "Repository URL" box
4. "Project directory name" should automatically populate with the respository name. If not, enter it manually.
5. Click "Create Project"
6. The project should now be open, as shown in the upper right corner next to the small image of "R" in a blue cube.

# Adding a New Script to Repository
1. With the relevant .Rproj file open (using steps described above), create a new script as you normally would.
2. Save the file to your local machine. 
3. Click on the "Git" tab in the Environment pane of RStudio. You should now see the new file listed. 
4. Once you have made the changes to the script file: Tools > Version Control > Commit
5. Select the new file from the list in the upper left corner. 
6. **When committing a new script for the first time, also select the .Rproj from the list.
7. Add a commit message describing the change (this will appear on Github with each change).
8. Click "Commit"
9. If necessary, enter your Github username and password.
10. Go to Github or Github desktop to ensure that the script has now been added.

** Not 100% sure yet if you have to do this at all, or if it needs to be done every time, or if it only needs to be done for a new script file.
